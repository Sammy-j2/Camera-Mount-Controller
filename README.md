# Camera Mount Controller

---

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a side initiative based on work conducted in a fatigue laboratory. The primary objective is to provide precise motorized control to the fixture holding a camera, enhancing its positioning capabilities during mechanical testing. Existing CAD files from a former student were adapted for efficiency, although alternative design choices may have been preferable in some cases.
