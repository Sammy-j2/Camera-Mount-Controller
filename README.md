Camera Mount Controller
Project Overview
This project was developed as a side initiative based on work conducted in a fatigue laboratory. The primary objective is to provide precise motorized control to the fixture holding a camera, enhancing its positioning capabilities during mechanical testing. Existing CAD files from a former student were adapted for efficiency, although alternative design choices may have been preferable in some cases.

Hardware Components
Microcontroller: Arduino Pro Nano
Motor Driver: DRV8833
Motor: High Torque Motor (controlled by the DRV8833)
Servo: Camera Angle Servo (for angle adjustment)
Features
Motorized control of the camera mount for improved flexibility
Servo-driven mechanism for precise camera angle adjustment
Designed to integrate with a uniaxial load testing machine
Mechanical components adapted from legacy CAD designs
Notes:
The CAD files used in this project were modified from previous work...
Further customization may be required to suit specific experimental setups.
